                                     CALC:  An On-line Calculator for PCs.


     CALC is a sophisticated calculator program for IBM-PCs and compatibles.
CALC has an intuitive user-interface, permitting quick entry of equations.
Furthermore, CALC has a number of useful features, including:  on-line help,
the ability to define variables and functions, the capacity to write results
to an output file, the ability to compute (and simplify) analytic derivatives
of user-defined functions, and an interface to the WordPerfect 5.1 equation
editor.


Examples:

? 10.5 * (3^(10/3))                 -- user input
  10.5 * (3^(10/3)) == 408.877      -- output from CALC
? A=(SIN(45)/45)*(ln(45))
  A:== 0.59816
? F(X) = (x^2)/ exp(x)
  Function :: F(X) = (X^2)/ EXP(X)
? F(3)
  F(3) == .448084
? /DERIV F
  dF  / dX  = F'  ==>
  F'(X) = (((( 2*X))*EXP(X))-((X^ 2)*(EXP(X))))/(EXP(X)^ 2)
? F'(1)
  F'(1) == .367879
? /SIMP F' F'S
? /FUN F'S
  F'S(X) = ( 2*(X*EXP(X))-((X^ 2)*EXP(X)))/(EXP(X)^ 2)
? /FUN F'S WP FS.EQ
  Funtion: F'S         , written (for WP 5.1 equation editor) to FS.EQ




                                           Installation Instructions

      There are 3 versions of CALC: a small version (CALCS.EXE), a medium
sized version (CALCM.EXE) and full-scale version (CALC.EXE).  The smaller
versions do not support the full set of CALC features, but they are useful if
disk-space is limited, or if you would like to run CALC at the same time as
some other program.

        After deciding which version(s) of CALC you want, simply copy them to
your utilities subdirectory.  To run CALC, just enter CALC (or CALCS or CALCM)
from the DOS prompt; no special installation program need be executed.

      If you are WordPerfect 5.1 user, you should also copy the CVTCALC.WPM
macro to your WP 5.1 Macros subdirectory.  This macro facilitates the use of
the WP 5.1 equation editor as a means of displaying CALC output.

     Upon running CALC, if extraneous characters (such as [0m)) appear on
your screen, you need to install ANSI.SYS.  This can be done by including the
statement DEVICE=ANSI.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file.

                                                 Introduction

        CALC has a number of useful features, including:

         Up to 100 variables may be saved.
         Variables can be freely inserted into equations.
         25 intrinsic functions, such as SIN and LOG, are available.
         User defined functions can be created and used.
         Analytic derivative of any user defined function can be derived.
         User defined functions, such as derivatives, can be simplified.
         Output can be exported to the WordPerfect 5.1 equation editor.
         Extensive on-line help.

     To use CALC, simply enter the equation you want to analyze; then hit
the ENTER key. For example:

      ? 9,000-(8.9E01*-2)/3.                         (user input)
      9,000-(8.9E01*-2)/3. == 9059.33333           (output from computer)

         (The question mark is the CALC prompt, and is used in the examples
          throughout this documentation to indicate "input from user").

      Alternatively, if you only need to perform a single calculation, you can
evaluate an equation directly from the DOS command line.  For example:
        C:>CALC 100+(6*9)
will return:
          100 + (6*9) = 154


      This document describes the features of CALC.  Much of this material is
also available in the on- line help, which can be accessed from CALC by
striking the F1 function key.

Note:  To exit CALC, hit the ESC key, or hit the F3 key and then the ENTER
       key.


                                                Basic Features

Entry of numbers.

         Numbers can be entered as real, integer or exponential notation
         (integers will be converted to real numbers).  Commas may be
         inserted (if desired) without having any effect on the
         number.  For example, the following entries have the same
         value:
                 9000.0  : 9000  :  9.0E+03   : 9,000.00 : 9,000

Precedence of math operators.

        In increasing order, the precedence of math operators is:

     + and - ; *, / and % ; ** or ^ ; functions ; negative sign ; parenthesis.

      Where:
             *  stands for multiplication: 4*7=28.
           %  stands for the mod operation: 14 % 6 = 2.
             ^ (or **) stand for exponentiation: 3^3 = 27.

        Example: 5 - 3+exp(5)^2 * -X ^ 3 + 6/9*5  is interpreted as:
              (5-  3) + ( (exp(5)^2) * ((-X)^ 3) ) ) +  ((6/9)*5)

       If no math operator is given, then multiplication is implicitly assumed.
       Example: 9 (x-8) + 11.3X is equivalent to (9*(x-8)) + (11.3*X).

       Caution: When using the E variable (see below), this
                    "implicit multiplication" may not work.
        Example: 5E-03 is interpreted as 0.00500, and not as (5*E)-3.

        Implicit multiplication is not fully supported in CALCS.

Variables.

        Variables are created with the following syntax: VarName = equation.

        Example: ? X1=98 - 2 (SIN(45) - .2)

        The variable name can be up to 12 characters long.  Alphabetics,
        digits, the apostrophe ( ' ), and the underscore ( _ ) are allowed
        characters.

        Example: VAR_1'

        There are two permanent variables: PI (3.141593) and E (2.718282).

        Special feature: To save the most recently computed value, use:
             ? VARNAME=/S

        Example:?  8*exp(3)/pi    (CALC returns the value 51.147398)
                   ?  TMPVAL=/S   (a variable with the name of TMPVAL
                        will be created and  assigned a value of 51.147398).


Permanent Functions.

        The following functions are supported:
          SIN   COS   TAN   ARCSIN  ARCCOS  ARCTAN
          SINH  COSH  TANH
          EXP   EXP10     LOG (or LN)    LOG10
          ABS   INT   SQRT  RADTODEG  DEGTORAD   FACT

        The trigonometric functions (SIN through ARCTAN) work either in
        degrees or radians.  To specify degrees, enter SIND, COSD, etc.  To
        specify radians, enter SINR, COSR, etc.  If you SIN, COS, etc.
        (without the D or R modifier), the "default trigonometric" type is
        assumed (see below for how to set default trigonometric type).

        SINH, COSH, and TANH refer to the hyperbolic functions.

        FACT is the factorial function (FACT(5)=5*4*3*2*1).  RADTODEG
        converts radians to degrees, DEGTORAD converts degrees to radians.
        ABS returns the absolute value, INT truncates the decimal component
        of a real number.  LOG (or LN) returns the natural logarithm, while
        LOG10 returns the base-10 logarithm.



User-Functions (not available in CALCS).

        Up to 34 user-functions can be created and saved.  The syntax for
        creating user-functions is:

        FunctionName(ArgumentName)=Equation

        where FunctionName and ArgumentName can be up to 12 characters long.

        The definition of a user-function (its equation) can reference
        variables and previously defined user-functions.  Variables need
        not have been defined, if they do not exist they will be created
        and assigned a value of zero.  When you use a user function, the
        argument can consist of any valid equation, which may include other
        user-functions.

        Example:         ? F1(X)=ABS(X*33-100)+2 + VAR1
                         ? VAR1=10 + LN(10)
                         ? GDX2(ZY)= SIN(ZY) + F1(ZY^2/3) /F1(VAR1)
                         ? VAR2=GDX2(3+F1(3)) - F1(F1(3) - 3)


                                                Special Features

Continuation Lines       (not available in CALCS).
        If your equation will not fit on one line, put a ! at the end of
        the line.  You will then be prompted for the "continuation" of
        the equation. Example:
          ? X1 =  123 -515 + 151 ( 124 - sin(3) ) !
      :More!?   + 100 * ln(PI*X0)

Parenthesis.

        The three types of  parentheses, "(", "{", and "[", can be freely
        mixed.  { and [ will be converted to (, ] and } will be converted
        to ).

Temporary Exit to DOS.

       To temporarily exit to DOS, hit the Cntl-E key at the CALC prompt
       (the ?).  After you enter one DOS command, you will be returned to CALC.

On-line Equation Editing           (not available in CALCS).

        While entering an equation, one can use the left and right arrow
        keys, and the Home, End, Delete, and Ins keys.  Ins toggles between
        typeover and insert mode.  To indicate which mode is currently
        active, a block (signifying insert mode) or a vertical bar
        (signifying typeover mode) will briefly appear.

        A history command, modeled after the DOSKEY feature of DOS 5.0, is
        also available.  The Up and Down arrows will recall, and display on
        the input line, up to 20 of your prior entries to CALC (10 in
        CALCM).  Alternatively, the PgUp and PgDn keys can be used, with
        prior entries scrolled up the screen rather then overwritten.

Precision and Memory Requirements.

        CALC uses double precision (64 bit) arithmetic, with a maximum
        value of 1.0E+300 permitted.  For functions, the maximum value of
        the arguments are:  SIN, etc.= 1.0e10; Factorial = 169 (negative
        numbers and non-integers are not allowed); and Exp = 750.

        Each equation can contain up to 600 characters.  Up to 100
        variables and 34 user-functions can be active at the same time.
        CALC sets aside memory for 6000 "equation nodes" (1400 in CALCM)
        that are used to store user-functions.  Note that an equation node
        is not equivalent to a character in an equation (each occurence of
        a variable, function name, value, and math operator occupies one
        equation node).

        If you use up all the available memory, or exceed the number of
        permitted variables (or user- functions) a message to that effect
        will appear.  To free up memory (or remove unneeded user- functions
        and variables), use /INIT (see below). Switches and Advanced
        Features.

        Certain commands are "switches" that are used to set defaults,
        initialize variables, and invoke advanced features.  Note that the
        advanced features (DERIV, SUM and SIMPLIFY) are not available in
        CALCM and CALCS.

        The following lists these switches.  Switches can be "turned on"
        either by entering the name (always preceded by a / character), or
        in some cases by hitting a function key.  Note that [xx] signifies
        optional arguments.

Fkey   Switch Name             Short Description

    /INIT  [option1 option2]      :: Initialize, and set various CALC options
    /DEFINE                       :: ReDefine ALL user-defined variables
    /RADIANS                      :: Set default trigonometric type to radians.
    /DEGREES                      :: Set default trigonometric type to degrees.
    /VAR   [varname] :            :: List a  variable and its value.
F2  /FUN [FuncName WP WPName] :: Display a function (CALC or WP mode)
F5  /OUT  [file.ext]              :: Send output to a ".LST" file.
F6  /IN  [file.ext]               :: Read equations from an input file
F7  /DERIV [function newname] :: Compute derivative of a  user function.
F8  /SUM  n1 .. nN                :: Sum a list of numbers & terms
F9  /SIMPLIFY [function newname] :: Simplify a function


/INIT [option1 option2]           (not available in CALCS).

        /INIT is used to initialize a variety of CALC options, and to free
        up memory.  Several options are available under /INIT.  Option1 can
        be one of the following (if no option1 is given, you will be asked
        to select one):
            ALL  == Removes all functions and variables.
            FUN  == Removes selected functions.
            VAR  == Removes selected variables
            SIMP == Sets parameters that control the extent of simplification.
            FMT  == Set parameters that control appearance of output.
                           (for CALCS and CALCM, FMT is a separate switch).

        If FUN (or VAR) is used without option2, a list of currently active
        user-functions (or variables) is displayed, and you choose whether
        to retain or remove each function (or variable).  This is
        especially useful if you run out of memory, or exceed the permitted
        number of user-functions (or variables).

        There are seven parameters that can be set under SIMP (not
        available in CALCM).  By default, all options are turned on.  The
        options are:
           1) REPeat simplification until no improvement
           2) REMove extra parenthesis [eg. ((X/4)) ==> (X/4) ].
           3) MOVe - into parenthesis [eg. -(3-5) ==> (-3+5) ].
           4) Compute simple MATh [eg. (3+4) ==> 7 ].
           5) Compute simple FUNctions [eg. (LN(3) ==> 1.09 ].
           6) Do SIMple algebra [eg. (X*1) ==> X ].
           7) Do complex ALGebra [eg. ((X*X)/X) ==> X ].


        FMT is used to control how output will be displayed.  There are
        four options under FMT (iv is not available in CALCM)
        i)       Use exponential notation. Example: 0.12E-02 instead of
                 0.0012.
        ii)       Number of digits to right of decimal point.  Note that if
                  a number has an integer value, it
                 will be written without a decimal point.
        iii)      Number of character to use when displaying functions (see
                 /FUN below).
        iv)      Whether to use the MATRIX command when displaying
                 functions with WP 5.1 style (see /FUN below).

        Example:         ? /INIT SIM REP     (toggles the REPeat
                                               simplification option)
                         ? /INIT FUN F1      (removes the F1 user-function)

/DEFINE                           (not available in CALCS)

        /DEFINE is used to quickly assign values to all currently defined
        user-variables.  The current value of each variable is displayed,
        and the user can then change its value, or retain the current
        value.

/RADIANS and /DEGREES             (not available in CALCS).

        Set the type of all future invocations of "generic" trigonometric
        functions.  A generic trigonometric function lacks a R or D; for
        example, SIN is the generic version of SIND and SINR.  Note that
        previously created user-defined functions that access these
        "generic" trigonometric functions are not effected by these
        commands.  In fact, in the function definition, SIN, etc.  are
        replaced with SIND, etc.  (or SINR, etc.), depending on whether
        RADIANS or DEGREES was selected at the time the equation was
        specified.  The default is DEGREES.

/VAR [varname]

        /VAR will display the value of a variable.  If no [varname] is
        given, the value of all variables will be displayed.


/FUN [FuncName WP WpName] (not available in CALCS).

        /FUN will display the current user-defined functions (the equation
        will be displayed).  If no [FuncName] is given, then all the
        user-defined functions are displayed.  If FuncName is given, the
        entire function is displayed.  When it is not given, only the first
        K characters of each function are displayed, where K is set under
        the FMT option of /INIT.  By default, K is equal to 40.  Note that
        the maximum characters that can be displayed, per function, is 4500
        (1000 in CALCM).

        When the entire function can not be displayed, a flashing >>
        character will appear at the far right of the screen.

        The optional [WP WpName] arguments (not available in CALCM) are
        used to instruct CALC to create WP 5.1 equation editor style output
        and send it to a file with the name WpName.

        These "WP_style" files contains special commands that are used by the
        WP 5.1 equation editor to prettify the display.  For example,
        exponents are displayed as superscripts, fractions are displayed
        with the numerator over denominator (horizontal line in between),
        parenthesis are correctly sized, and if MATRIX is selected (the
        default, see /INIT FMT above) elements will be stacked on top of
        each other to save horizontal space.

        A special macro file (CVTCALC.WPM) is available that facilitates
        the use of these "WP_style" files by WordPerfect.  To use this
        macro, after entering WP 5.1, you run the CVTCALC macro (say, by
        hitting the ALT-F10) key.  You will then be asked to provide a
        "name of a function file generated by CALC".  You should then
        provide the name of the "WP_style" file that you created using
        /FUN.  It is important to remember that if you do not include a
        path (a drive and/or directory) in your file name, WordPerfect will
        look in its default document directory for the "function file".  In
        other words, you will probably need to specify the subdirectory, as
        well as the name, of the "function file".

        (Note: to use CVTCALC, CVTCALC.WPM  must be installed in
        WordPerfect macros subdirectory).

        Example 1: ?/FUN F1X WP F1X.LST
                  (creates a file with the name F1X.LST in your current
                   directory -- the directory you ran CALC from).

        Example 2: ?/FUN F2X WP \MYDIR\SAMP1.Q
                  (creates a file with the name SAMP1.Q in the \MYDIR
                   subdirectory).


/OUT [file.ext].

        /OUT will cause all results to be written to an output file, as
        well as to the screen.  When this "echo to an output file" mode is
        on, the CALC cursor will be in reverse video rather then bold (this
        is not true for CALCS).  To stop this echoing, enter /OUT again
        (without a file.ext).  If you do not provide a filename (in
        file.ext), you will be asked to supply one.

        When user-function display is requested (using /FUN FuncName), and
        /OUT is "on", you will be asked whether the output should be in
        CALC style or WP style (not available in CALCS or CALCM).  CALC
        style is similar to how CALC equations are entered.  In fact,
        output generated by /OUT can be used as input to CALC (see /IN
        below) without modification.  WP style is designed to be read by
        the WordPerfect (WP) 5.1 equation editor.


        While this method of generating WP style output will work, in many
        circumstances it is recommended that /FUN, with the [FuncName WP
        WPName] options, be used.  In particular, the /FUN method is
        designed to generate a file that is usable by the CVTCALC
        WordPerfect 5.1 macro (CVTCALC automates the generation of
        WordPerfect equations, using files created by CALC).

        Example:         ? /OUT CALC.LST
                           ... several calc commands
                         ? /OUT
        (the results of the several calc commands will be written
        to CALC.LST).

/IN [file.ext]                    (not available in CALCS).

        /IN causes input to be read from an input file rather then from the
        keyboard.  Each line of the input file can be up to 200 characters
        long, and any single equation can have up to 600 characters in it.
        Otherwise, all CALC features are permitted (except for the use of
        /IN).  If you do not provide an input file (file.ext), you will be
        asked to supply one.

        Example: ? /IN TST.IN,   where TST.IN is a file containing:
        X1=23
        /REM This is a sample function
        FOO(X)=(X/44)*ABS(X1)^2
        DD=FOO(X1^3.2)
        PI*DD/5.5
        EXIT

        Notes:  The EXIT command is the equivalent to ESC (CALC terminates
        and the the computer is returned to the DOS prompt).  /REM is a
        "remark" command, the contents of the line are ignored (if /OUT is
        selected, the contents of the line will be written to the output
        file).

/DERIV [FuncName NewName]         (not available in CALCM or CALCS).

        /DERIV will take a previously defined function and compute its
        derivative using repetitive applications of the chain rule.  The
        results are saved as a separate function user-function.  This new
        user-function can be accessed just like an ordinary user-defined
        function (i.e.; one entered by you from the keyboard).

        When the NewName option is not given, a NewName is automatically
        generated by adding an apostrophe (') to FuncName.  If FuncName is
        not given, you will be asked for the FuncName and the NewName.

        When a user-function has other user functions embedded within it,
        the derivatives of these embedded user-functions must be created
        before you take its own derivative.  Furthermore, the names of
        these derivatives (of the embedded user-functions) must follow the
        default (apostrophe appended to the end of the FuncName).

         Example:         ? F(X)=SIN(X)/X^2
              Function :: F(X)= SIN(X)/(X^2)
             ? /DERIV F
             dF   / dX   == F '  ==>
              : F'(X)= (((COSD(X))*X^2)-(SIND(X)*(2*X)))/((X^2)^2)
             ? G(X)= F(X^2) + 1/F(X)
             Function :: G(X)= F(X^2) + 1/F(X)
             ? /DERIV G
             dG   / dX   == G '  ==>
              : G'(X ) = ((F'(X^ 2))*(( 2*X))) + (-((F'(X)))/(F(X)^ 2))

       NOTE: Simplification of the derivative (see /SIMP below) is recommended.

/SUM list                                  (not available in CALCS or CALCM).

       /SUM will add up a list of terms, where each item in the list is
        separated by a space.

      Example:           /SUM 4 5 EXP(2*PI) 20/SIND(45) 9.5
        is converted to: 4+5+EXP(2*PI)+20/SIND(45)+9.5 ==  582.276020


/SIMP [FuncName newname]          (not available in CALCS or CALCM).

        /SIMP is used to simplify user-defined functions.  /SIMP is
        especially useful in conjunction with /DERIV, since /DERIV makes no
        attempt to simplify.  The major use of /SIMP is to improve
        readability, especially when the simplified function is converted
        into a WP style output file and read into the WP 5.1 equation
        editor.

        A variety of options (see /INIT SIMP) controls what methods are
        used to simplify the equation.  While simplification will usually
        reduce the complexity of an equation, it may not be complete;
        visual inspection will often reveal further possibilities for
        simplification.

        In almost all cases /SIMP will not change the results of an
        equation.  The only time that simplified functions yield different
        results from their unsimplifed counterpart is when an implicit
        divide by zero occurs.  For example, suppose F(X)=(Z2*X)/X is
        simplified to F_S(X)=Z2; if X=0, F_S(X) returns the value of Z2,
        while the F(X) returns a divide by zero error.

        If newname is not entered, a name is generated by appending _S to
        the FuncName.  If FuncName is not entered, you will be asked to
        supply both a FuncName and a newname.

        Example:         ? F(X)=SIN(X)/X^2
                         ? /DERIV F
                         dF   / dX   == F '  ==>
                         : F'(X)= (((COSD(X))*X^2)-(SIND(X)*(2*X)))/((X^2)^2)
                         ? /SIMP F'
                         ? /FUN F'_S
                         F'_S(X) = (COSD(X)*(X^2)-(2*SIND(X)*X))/(X^4)

        Note: An option can be added before the FuncName to temporarily
        (for FuncName only) set the simplification options.  These are:
                 1 ==    REMove extra parenthesis only.
                 2 ==    REMove extra parenthesis, MOVe negative signs into
                         parenthesis, and compute MATh.
                 3 ==    All options on.

        Example: ? /SIMP 2 F FS2
