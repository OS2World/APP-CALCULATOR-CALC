                CALC  -- An On-Line Calculator for PCs

To install CALC, simple copy the desired version(s) of CALC to your
hard drive (say, to your /UTILITIES subdirectory).  If you are a WordPerfect
5.1 user, copy the CVTCALC.WPM file to the /MACROS subdirectory of
WordPerfect.

CALC is a data product of the USDA Economic Research Service.

However, the Economic Research Service would appreciate a citation for this
product whenever it is referenced in a scholarly work or other publication.

The three versions of CALC are (size in parenthesis):

CALCS.EXE -- Small version, does not support functions.

CALCM.EXE -- Mid-sized version, does not support derivatives or
                        simplification.

CALC.EXE  -- All features supported.

The largest CALC is the most useful, but it's size can be a problem.  For
example, if you temporarily exit to DOS from WordPerfect, you will not be
able to run CALC (not enough memory), but you will be able to run CALCM and
CALCS.

The following documentation files are also on this disk:

CALC.DOC     -- Contains an ASCII version of the documentation.
                (much of this domcumentation is included in the on-line help).

CALC.WP5     -- WP 5.1 version of CALC.DOC.

CALCSAMP.WP5 -- A WP 5.1 file that contains a sample of the derivative,
                simplification, and WP style output features of CALC.
